# Flo Mobility - Full Stack Developer Challenge

This is a full-stack mission planning and visualization application built for the Flo Mobility Full Stack Developer Challenge. It integrates a ROS 2 (Humble) Turtlesim robot simulator with a modern web-based UI for robot control, path recording, station saving, and mission execution.

## üöÄ Features

- **Turtle Movement Controls**: Use keyboard or on-screen arrows to control the turtle in ROS 2 Turtlesim.
- **3D Visualization**: Turtle‚Äôs movement is mirrored in real-time using React Three Fiber.
- **Station and Path Management**:
  - Save stations (checkpoints).
  - Record and save paths between stations.
  - View saved stations and paths.
- **Mission Planning**:
  - Select a saved path and execute a mission.
  - The turtle follows the path from the selected station.
- **Real-time Sync**: Movement and mission execution synced between frontend, backend, and ROS 2 simulator.
